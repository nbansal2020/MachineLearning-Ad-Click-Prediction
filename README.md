As a result, click prediction systems are essential and widely used for sponsored search and real-time bidding. For this competition, we used a modified dataset to build and test prediction models. 

Used a modified version of Kaggle dataset provided here (https://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction).
